Customer Data Quality & Marketing Insights Analysis.This project involved analyzing a customer dataset with the goal of improving data quality and extracting actionable business insights to support strategic marketing efforts.

The process began with data cleaning in Microsoft Excel, where I standardized text fields, removed duplicates, handled missing values, and validated email addresses and phone numbers. This step was critical to ensure the dataset was accurate, consistent, and ready for reliable analysis.

After cleaning, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Excel charts and functions to uncover patterns and trends. Key visualizations included:
Histograms to analyze customer age distribution
Boxplots and averages to explore income levels
Pie charts to show gender representation
Bar charts to highlight customer distribution by region

These insights allowed me to identify the business's core audience and recommend specific marketing actions—such as focusing campaigns on customers aged 25–40 in top-performing regions, and tailoring offers based on income tiers.
This project demonstrates my ability to work with raw data, clean and structure it, perform insightful analysis, and communicate findings clearly to inform business decisions.
